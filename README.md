I am a tech lead and Full-stack web developer with 14+ years of proven experience. Tech stacks that I have worked on include C#, .Net Framework, Net Core, 
ASP.Net, MVC, web services, SQL, Web APIs (REST API), WCF, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, JQuery, AJAX, OOP, Design Patterns, Microsoft SQL Server for database 
development, IIS web server, and Git/GitHub. I have developed a number of web based and desktop based applications using the above technologies 
including designing the entire relational database for each application.  Currently I am exploring technologies like Machine Learning (AI), python, AWS, DevOps, Azure, React, Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, and Micro Services and actively looking for a developer position in one of top US companies. Please don’t hesitate to contact me at birukaabel@gmail.com or (+251)-912020941. I’d be happy to schedule a discussion/interview to go over my work-experience or qualifications in more detail.
